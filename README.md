# Marcador de Truco
Its a score counter for a brazillian card game :)

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with React, which means it can be used on both desktop and smartphones and can be added to the home screen as an app, almost indistinguishable from a real native app.

The app is hosted on Firebase, and you can see it working here:
